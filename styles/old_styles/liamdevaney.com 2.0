Photoshop and Photography

Reset

I am a keen Photographer and experienced in the use of Photoshop. I have taken and edited all of the images shown above. This is a random selection of the images I have taken. I am at my best when working under pressure and know that this will be a useful trait in the fast paced and challenging company I am eager to join.


Web Development



I have years of experience in digital media development. Many of these years have been spent coding. Html, CSS, Objective C, Action Script and SQL have all been studied. 

I am not the world's best coder, however I can look at a page of code I've never seen before and identify tags, functions, or formulas. I have a great understanding of the logical process of coding as well as the design of software systems. 

I have designed, coded and uploaded my Portfolio site independently. The two uses of JavaScript are the only time I decided to remix/cannibalise code from another source. I edit prewritten code with ease and as stated have used this technique to code some of this site. I have never been taught or attempted to learn JavaScript/Jquery but I have managed to use it on my Portfolio site. 

Studying Computer Science at the University of Bournemouth I gained a grounded understanding of how to design and produce code correctly. Studying Entertainment Technology at the University of Portsmouth showed me how I can use these coding techniques online. My greatest strengths lie in my ability to learn quickly and adapt my behaviour and skills accordingly. In particular I find it easy to use new software and can quickly find an efficient and productive workflow.

The birth

On July 4th, 1985 in the early hours of the morning I was squeezed into existence and the world would never be the same again... for my parents.


1990's

In the early ninety’s I joined the Rosary RC Primary school, the education begins.


Big boy School

In 1996 I enter secondary school St Marks Catholic School and my love for computers is fuelled. Whilst at St Marks I will gain 9 GCSEs Grade A-C including double Science, Math, English, and Electronics. In the same year I joined the Cranford Kestrels Trampolining Club and began learning how to fall with style.


College

In 2000 I moved into St Marks Sixth Form College where I studied A-level Physics and an Advanced GNVQ in Information and Communication Technology. Continuing to trampoline I also complete the Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and Volunteer as a Redcap in Lourdes.


Bournemouth

In 2003 I was accepted into the University of Bournemouth where I studied Computer Science. Living in Bournemouth and away from my family for the first time was an interesting time. I had more than enough fun with my new freedom and learnt a lot in this time (mostly the hard way).


A bump in the road

In 2005 after two years of studying Computer Science at the University of Bournemouth I returned home without enough credits to continue into the third year of the course. I immediately found a job in Pacemaker Logistics where I began saving with the intention of returning to University. During this time I also took a night course in the Audio/Midi Recording and Editing.


Back on track

After a year and a half at Pacemaker I was accepted into the University of Portsmouth where I studied Entertainment Technology. I joined the University Gymnastics and Trampolinging team as well as the Kayaking Society.


The sandwich year

I joined Binary Vision in 2009 where I worked full time as a Production Assistant. This was a valuable and challenging year. Answering directly to the Managing Directors I gained a firm understanding of the digital media industry and of the importance of time management. I also experienced the importance of gaining the customers confidence and building rapport.


The end of an era

Returning to Portsmouth to complete the final year of my Degree in 2009 I had a newfound confidence following my year with Binary Vision. I toured with the University Trampolining and Kayaking Groups representing the University around the UK as well as Ireland and Spain. I also met my partner and the love of my life Hannah.


Real life begins

In early 2010 I graduated from the University of Portsmouth, BSc (Hons) Entertainment Technology. I returned home and immediately found a job with Pacemaker working in the administration office.


Everything changes

Still working at Pacemaker, 2011 would prove to be the hardest year of my life to date. In 2011 at the end of June my Father passed away after a lengthy battle with Cancer. It is without doubt the hardest thing that I have experienced and I miss him every day. My Mother and Father created a large and loving family who support each other annoy each other in equal measures, they are an inspiration. In early July I witnessed the birth of my daughter Isabella and became the prod father of a beautiful girl.


Where am I now

In 2012 I have a beautiful partner and daughter, a degree in Entertainment Technology and a thirteen year working history. Currently working for Nightfreight Logistics in Southall my main duties include managing customers’ accounts and producing/maintaining reports within Excel. My greatest strengths lie in my ability to learn quickly and adapt my behaviour and skills accordingly. In particular I find it easy to use new software and can quickly find an efficient and productive workflow.


Experience

My experience as a Production Assistant with Binary Vision was the best of my career and I am keen to demonstrate my skills and gain experience in a demanding and fast paced work environment. I have a range of abilities relevant to the Digital Media Industry. These skills, which I have homed in University and at work, will help me to adapt to any position.


What I want to be

Digital Media Producer seeking employment within Digital Media Agency. Constantly wanting to improve my production and managerial skills I aspire to work in an environment that challenges me to continue learning whilst offering opportunities to advance my career. I strive to portray myself as a well-mannered, thoughtful and approachable individual. I am an ambitious independent learner who can remain focused when working under pressure.


What I've done

Degree in Entertainment Technology, University Of Portsmouth. Qualified as a Trampoline Coach. Completed a sprint triathlon(2011). Cycled from London to Brighton off road(2009) and around the Isle of Wight(2010) for the British Heart Foundation. I also Enjoy keeping healthy and active by regularly playing sports. Currently involved in Trampolining, Gymnastics, Swimming, Cycling and jogging on a weekly basis. Also involved in Football, Gallic Football and Kayaking when possible.

“Liam worked for us in his work experience year during his degree, with additional freelance work for us after that.

By the time he went back to college, Liam had taken the opportunity to improve his digital production skills dramatically; he had become a real asset to the production department at Binary Vision, doing vital often time-critical work on major projects for clients including the RAF and the General Pharmaceutical Council. 

While at BV, he was also able to gain important skills in time management and project planning.“
